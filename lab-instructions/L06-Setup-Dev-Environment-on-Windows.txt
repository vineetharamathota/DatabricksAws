
 Lab 6 - Setup development environment on Windows
 -------------------------------------------------- 

 1. Install AWS CLI on Windows
	URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
	
	1.1 Download and run the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (64-bit):
	    https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
		
	1.2 Once install, you wil have a ".aws" folder created under your windows user directory
		(such as C:\Users\<user-name>\.aws)
 
 2. Create a user profile for AWS CLI on Windows.
	2.1. Log-in to AWS Management Console with root account (as with Admin account)
    2.2. Create an AWS User
    2.3. Download the Credentials file (in the last step of the user creation process)
    2.4. Now a open a terminal and configure the user
	
		aws configure
	         
		=> Enter the values for 'AWS Access Key ID' and 'AWS Secret Access Key' from the downloaded credentials file.
		=> Keep the region and format as defaults
				
	2.5. Validate the configuration	
	
		aws s3 list
		=> The following command lists all the buckets in the user account			 
 
 3. Setup Python Virtual Environment and install boto3 and JupyterLab
 
	3.1. Open 'Anaconda Command Prompt' and install python dev. environement as described below:
	
	3.2. Create a working directory (DatabricksProjects) for all your Databricks projects
 
		mkdir E:\Databricks\Projects
		cd E:\Databricks\Projects
		
	3.3. Create a python virtual environment in your project working directory.
 
		python -m venv databricks-venv			
		-> This creates a directory called 'databricks-venv' with all basic python packages in the current folder.
	
	3.4. Activate the v-env
 
		cd .\databricks-venv\Scripts
		activate      (this will activate the virtual environement)
	
		NOTE: To deactivate the v-env, run 'deacticate' in the same folder (i.e databricks-venv\Scripts)
			
	3.5. Install boto3 inside the venv
		
		=> NOTE: Make sure you have activated the venv and inside the correct dirctory.
			
		cd E:\Databricks\Projects
		pip3 install boto3
				
	3.6. Install JupyterLab
		
		=> NOTE: Make sure you have activated the venv and inside the correct dirctory.
		pip3 install jupyterlab
		
 4. Validate boto3
	
	4.1 Open a anaconda terminal and activate your python venv 	
	4.2 Do as shown below: 
		
		(base) E:\>cd Databricks\Projects
		(base) E:\Databricks\Projects>.\databricks-venv\Scripts\activate
		(databricks-venv) (base) E:\Databricks\Projects>python
		>>> s3 = boto3.client('s3')
		>>> s3.list_buckets()
		
 5. Validate JupyterLab
 
	4.1 Open a anaconda terminal and activate your python venv 	
	4.2 Do as shown below: 
	
		(databricks-venv) (base) E:\Databricks\Projects>jupyter lab
		
		This opens a browser windo with Jupyter Lab
		-> If the Browser tab is not automatically opens for you, you can copy paste the URL shown on the terminal.
	
	4.3 Double click on 'Python 3' button under 'Notebooks' section
		Name: testdev.ipynb
		
	4.3 Write the following code in the notebook
	
		import boto3
		
		s3 = boto3.client('s3')
		s3.list_buckets()
		
		buckets = s3.list_buckets()['Buckets']
		bucket_name = [ bucket['Name'] for bucket in buckets]
		bucket_name
