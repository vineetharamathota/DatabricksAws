  
  Lab 10 - Perform CRUD operations using Delta tables
  ----------------------------------------------------
  
 1. Create a single node 'All-purpose compute' cluster.
 
 2. Import the notebook provided for this lab.
 
		Notebooks to import:
		
		* Delta-1-Create-Sample-Data.dbc
		* Delta-2-Update-Delete-Delta-Tables.dbc
		* Delta-3-Merge.dbc
		* Delta-3-Merge-SQL.dbc
		* Delta-4-Merge-Conditional.dbc
 
 
 3. Open the notebook 'Delta-2-Update-Delete-Delta-Tables.dbc' and run the cells.
    Examine the commands to understand how delta format and Delta tables are being used.
	
		In this notebook, we demostrate the following:
			
		* Create source dataframes from well-formed JSON strings (first notebook)
		* Save the dataframes into a directory in delta format
		* Create dataframe from the delta files
		* Create a DeltaTable reading from delta file path
		* Perform an UPDATE using the DeltaTable
		* Perform a DELETE using the DeltaTable
			
	
 4. Open the notebook 'Delta-3-Merge.dbc' & 'Delta-3-Merge-SQL.dbc' and run the cells.
    Examine the commands to understand how delta format and Delta tables are being used.
	
		In this notebook, we demostrate the following:
			
		* Create source dataframes from well-formed JSON strings (first notebook)
		* Save the dataframes into a directory in delta format
		* Create dataframe from the delta files
		* Create a DeltaTable reading from delta file path
		* Perform MERGE operation using the DeltaTable  
			
			
 5. Open the notebook 'Delta-4-Merge-Conditional.dbc' and run the cells.
    Examine the commands to understand how delta format and Delta tables are being used.
	
		In this notebook, we demonstrate the following:
			
		* Create source dataframes from well-formed JSON strings (first notebook)
		* Save the dataframes into a directory in delta format
		* Create dataframe from the delta files
		* Create a DeltaTable reading from delta file path
		* Perform Insert, Update and Delete data using MERGE.
