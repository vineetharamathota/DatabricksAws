
  Lab : Accessing Databricks Terminal via Web
  ---------------------------------------------
  
 1. Launch databricks workspace.
  
 2. Enable web terminal in your databricks account
  
	Open "Admin Settings" option from Accounts menu (top-right)
	Go to "Workspace Setting" -> Advanced -> Enable 'Web Terminal' toggle.
	Refresh the page.
	
 3. Launch a All-purpose compute cluster. Wait until the cluster is active.
 
	Open the cluster page. 
	 
 4. Click on 'Apps' tab 
 
	Click on 'Web Terminal' button to launch web terminal.	 
	Here we can do any standard operation that are allowed under Ubuntu Linux. 
	 
 5. Run some sample commands
  
	uname -a
	python  (to launch python terminal)
		
 6. Exit the web terminal.
 
	Run 'exit' command and close the terminal.
		
 

  Lab 2 : Setup SSH for the Databricks cluster driver node
  --------------------------------------------------------
  
 1. Generate a Key pair on your machine. 
 
	** Make sure you have SSH installed on your local machine **
	
	1.1 Open a terminal and cd to the folder where you store ssh keys (.ssh folder in my case)
		C:\Users\ADMIN>dir .ssh
		
	1.2 Generate a Key-pair using SSH Keygen utility	
	
		C:\Users\ADMIN>ssh-keygen
		
		When prompted for the file, you can give as below:
			C:\Users\ADMIN/.ssh/id_databricks
			
		Leave Pass phrase as blank.
		
	1.3 This creates two files: id_databricks (private-key) and id_databricks.pub (public key)
	
	1.4 You need to copy the contents of id_databricks file while lauching the cluster.	
  
  
 2. Open the cluster page and click on 'Edit' button	
     (You can do these steps while creating a cluster also)	 
	 
 3. Go to 'Advanced options' section and click on 'SSH' tab.
    Paste the contents of the public-key file in the box (make sure you add no extra white spaces)
	
 4. Start/restart the cluster. 
 
 5. Configure EC2 instance to allow SSH traffic on port 2200 on the master node.
    (Databricks connects to SSH on port 2200)
	
 9. Login to AWS account, go to EC2 console and open the instance (of the master node).
	Open the 'Security group' and allow traffic on 2200 from your IP (or AnyWhere) in the Inbound rules.
	
 10. In the Databricks UI, open the cluster page and go to the SSH (under Advanced options) tab.
	 Here you see the command to connect to SSH. 
	 
 11. Open a terminal on your local machine and run the command shown in the SSH tab.
 
	ssh ubuntu@10.225.142.38 -p 2200 -i .\.ssh\id_databricks
