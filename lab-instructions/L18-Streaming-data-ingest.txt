
 Lab 18: Ingest streaming data (Web-logs) to Netcat server
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
 1. Launch databricks workspace.
  
 2. Enable web terminal in your databricks account
  
	Open "Admin Settings" option from Accounts menu (top-right)
	Go to "Workspace Setting" -> Advanced -> Enable 'Web Terminal' toggle.
	Refresh the page.
	
	
 3. Launch a All-purpose compute cluster. Wait until the cluster is active.
 
	Open the cluster page. 
	
	 
 4. Click on 'Apps' tab 
 
	Click on 'Web Terminal' button to launch web terminal.	 
	Here we can do any standard operation that are allowed under Ubuntu Linux. 
	
	
 5. Run the following commands to install 'gen_logs' (a streaming web-logs generator).
 
	sudo su - ubuntu
	git clone https://github.com/itversity/gen-logs-python3.git
	sudo mv -f gen-logs-python3/gen_logs /opt
	sudo chown -R `whoami` /opt/gen_logs
	export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gen_logs
	
	start_logs.sh
	
	tail_logs.sh
	
	Click Ctrl+C to terminate the above command.
  
  
 6. Start nc webserver (netcat) on this terminal so that we can ingest data into it.
	
		Type the following command:		
			nc -l -p 9000
			
		Note: Keep this terminal as is. 
		
		
 7. Validate the nc web-server on a separate terminal
 
	7.1 Open an other Web Terminal
	7.2 Type the following command to see if you can listen from nc
		telnet localhost 9000
		
		The window should show something like the following:
			Trying 127.0.0.1...
			Connected to localhost.
			Escape character is '^]'.			
	7.3 Type the following to quit telnet and also to terminate netcat
	
		Click Ctrl + ]
		telnet> quit
	
		This terminates the netcat server also in the first terminal.
